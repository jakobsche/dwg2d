# dwg2d
Vector graphic components

You can install this package in the Lazarus IDE. Then you get the new component class TDrawing2D in the component palette in the group Misc. If the package source code version will be newer than this file, there might be additional components in future. View the application project https://github.com/jakobsche/mofu as an example, how the package can be used!
